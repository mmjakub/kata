# Synchronize Files in Two Directories

>Imagine we want to write code for synchronizing two file directories, which weâ€™ll call the source and the destination:
>- If a file exists in the source but not in the destination, copy the file over.
>- If a file exists in the source, but it has a different name than in the destination, rename the destination file to match.
>- If a file exists in the destination but not in the source, remove it.

Simple solution that does not account for cases, when files in destination need to swap places in any way.
Possible approach to fix this issue:

- build graph of overlapping `MOVE`/`COPY` operations:
    - order operations properly if graph is a tree
    - if there are cycles use temp files or copy from source (harder case)

Prevented edge case when moved/copied file that overwrites a destination file that does not exist in source(and thus 
should normally be deleted), would be deleted.
